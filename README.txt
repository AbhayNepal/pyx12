What is Pyx12?
==============
    Pyx12 is a HIPAA X12 document validator and converter.  It parses an ANSI
    X12N data file and validates it against a representation of the
    Implementation Guidelines for a HIPAA transaction.  By default, it creates
    a 997 response. It can create an html representation of the X12 document
    or can translate to and from an XML representation of the data file. 

Where can I get it?
===================
    Pyx12 is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyx12/
