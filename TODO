Error Handling
  Stream Errors to XML
  Combine error XML with HTML/XML/997 output
  Error specifications - XML

Restructure maps
  Add loop wrappers to ISA/GS/ST
  Mod map_if and map_walker to match

HTML output
  Informational lines
    Explicit loops
  GS errors are re-printing at the GE level

Unit Testing
  map_walker
  x12file - HL
  map_if
  codes

Make C++ Modules
  x12file
  map_if
  map_walker
  codes

Base map_if children on map
  get by id quicker
  get by idx slower?

restructure maps.xml
  mapfile element
  map desc ???
