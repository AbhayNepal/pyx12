Altered segment interface
    No more [] indexing

Fixed xml generation bug:
    An element or composite containing data but marked as "Not Used" will not
    have an XML node generated.  This would not be a valid file anyway.

    Generation of XML nodes for empty element or composite data is supressed.
    These are just placeholders and the existence of an empty XML node
    communicates the same information as no node.

Fixed bug: Match any sub-loop of a containing loop.
