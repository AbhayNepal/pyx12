Fixed bug: SEG1 showing in AK304

Added a new XML output form: idtagqual.  This form appends the ID value to
    non-unique segment IDs

Draft map for Unsolicited 277: 277U.4010.X070.xml

Fixed bug: blank element validation

Fixed mis-named xid in 837.4010.X098.xml

Fixed incorrect spelling of xmlout parameter in pyx12.conf.xml.sample

Params can be cleared (values set to '')

Fixed out of order segments bug:
    If multiple segments with the same position ordinal occur out of order,
    could get an incorrect required segment missing error.

Base map_if segment children on dictionary

Altered segment interface
    No more [] indexing

Fixed xml generation bug:
    An element or composite containing data but marked as "Not Used" will not
    have an XML node generated.  This would not be a valid file anyway.

    Generation of XML nodes for empty element or composite data is supressed.
    These are just placeholders and the existence of an empty XML node
    communicates the same information as no node.

Fixed bug: Match any sub-loop of a containing loop.
